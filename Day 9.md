## NumPy Array Indexing

### Access Array Elements
Array indexing is the same as accessing an array element.
You can access an array element by referring to its index number.
The indexes in NumPy arrays start with 0, meaning that the first element has index 0, and the second has index 1 etc.

Example:
Get the first element from the following array:
```python
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(arr[0])
```
### Access 2-D Arrays
To access elements from 2-D arrays we can use comma separated integers representing the dimension and the index of the element.
Think of 2-D arrays like a table with rows and columns, where the dimension represents the row and the index represents the column.

Example:
Access the element on the first row, second column:
```python
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8,9,10]])
print('2nd element on 1st row: ', arr[0, 1])
```
### Access 3-D Arrays
To access elements from 3-D arrays we can use comma separated integers representing the dimensions and the index of the element.

Example:
Access the third element of the second array of the first array:
```python
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]])
print(arr[0, 1, 2])
```
### Negative Indexing
Use negative indexing to access an array from the end.

Example:
Print the last element from the 2nd dim:
```python
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5], [6,7,8,9,10]])
print('Last element from 2nd dim: ', arr[1, -1])
```
