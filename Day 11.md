## NumPy Array Shape

### Shape of an Array
The shape of an array is the number of elements in each dimension.

### Get the Shape of an Array
NumPy arrays have an attribute called shape that returns a tuple with each index having the number of corresponding elements.

Example:
Print the shape of a 2-D array:
```python
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]])
print(arr.shape)
```
The example above returns (2, 4), which means that the array has 2 dimensions, where the first dimension has 2 elements and the second has 4.
